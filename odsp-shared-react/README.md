# odsp-shared-react

## Setup prereq

Enlistment is now part of `odsp-common`. Please see enlistment instructions for `odsp-common` instead.

## About this package

`odsp-shared-react` is meant to host reusable react components. Great candidates are components that are

1. preferably generalized
2. have scenarios to be used in multiple apps (in `odsp-next` and `sp-client` repos).

All new components added should be accompanied with  a corresponding demo page entry.

## API Surface / Contracts
 
Only the top level bundles (directly under `/src`) are to be considered as part of the repo's API surface.
